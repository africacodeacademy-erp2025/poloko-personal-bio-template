## 🚀 My Journey

### 🌱 From Curiosity to Code  
I’ve always been intrigued by how things work, and this curiosity naturally led me into the world of software development.  
Back in high school I enjoyed solving methamatical problems and when I discovered about software development, I used my phone to learn basics of html without any formal lead, but that's how I discovered I am a software Enigineer.

### 🎓 Education & Experience  
My academic path has given me a strong foundation in software development, and I've supplemented that with hands-on experience through: 
* personal projects
* Enrolling and taking Applied AI in Computer Vision course at WorldQuant University
* Joining a recidency program at Africa Code Academy

### 🎯 Vision & Goals  
Through this program and beyond, I aim to:
- Learn how to learn and work in collaborative environments
- Contribute to open-source projects  
- Grow into a well-rounded full-stack developer  
- Mentor upcoming devs and promote tech accessibility in Africa
